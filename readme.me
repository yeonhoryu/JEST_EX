1. Project name: JEST Module Test

2. Summary:
This project involved installing the JEST extension locally and experimenting with test module coding. The goal was to create and upload matching functions.

The purpose of the JEST extension was to facilitate testing exercises for module assembly.

3. Program Source:
  1) Hello Test:
    This part involved coding the program's test module and developing matching sources.
  2) Package:
    While developing modules, I defined the purpose of functions and described how to use them. This package source established devDependencies in the JSON package and matched functions with test modules.
  3) Package-lock:
    Node.js utilized the JEST extension.
